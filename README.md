# Vending Machine
Thank you for taking a look at my reworked vending machine. It still accepts money, makes change, maintains inventory, and dispenses products. However, many of the classes have been refactored. A lot of the ideas on how to refactor them came from feedback from Pillar Technology and from the book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler. Also, the main class was completely redone from scratch so that it could be made in a test-driven way.
# Running the Vending Machine
To run the project: Open the command line in the directory VendingMachineKata (the directory that contains src). Type "gradle build" to build the project. Then type "java -jar build\libs\VendingMachineKata.jar" to run the project. Your screen should look like this: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27322821/29007424-a3e10454-7ac8-11e7-9672-5cfd7d0673eb.png.
